# Repository Overview
This repo holds the latest fonts and logos that should be used for my.aeries.com.

## Fonts
The fonts used are Nunito Sans for body text and small headers (h3-h6) and Aeries Sans (h1-h2) and large title areas. If you have questions for where a font should be used feel free to reach out for guidance

## Logos 
Logos are pretty straight forward, the logos that should be used are the ones that do not have the wing above the i in "Aeries"
